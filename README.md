# DBView

This app demonstrates how to graph the response of a biquad filter (audio).

I separated the UI aspect from the audio aspect to make it more understandable (to me, and hopefully to others).

Please note that the code is separated into Apple-created and me-created files. The Apple code license is LICENSE.txt, part of the archive. 

My code is proprietary. You can use it as inspiration though.
